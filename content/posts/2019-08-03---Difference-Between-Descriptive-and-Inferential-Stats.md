### DESCRIPTIVE STATS:

#### What is descriptive stats ?
Descriptive statistics is the application of mathematical techniques to summarize and showcase datasets that have been aggregated and cleaned so they can be understood.

#### Why is descriptive stats important ?
In todays world, large datasets are available in unstructured or structured manner. Companies, governments, and other organizations need and want to make sense of these data in order to make better decisions and solve problems within their teams. Descriptive stats allow people to summarize and understand these large datasets in a disciplined manner.

#### Techniques used in descriptive stats.
There are two categories that descriptive stats can fall into, central tendency and measures of variability. Central tendency, which  is the mean, median, and mode. Central tendency tends to look for the measure of the central distribution. The other, is measures of variability, which frequently measures standard deviation, range, interquartile and variance. Variability is synonym to spread or dispersion.

#### When to apply descriptive stats ?
Anytime a team or an individual wants to understand a dataset. Descriptive stats the perfect choice to use.


### INFERENTIAL STATS:

#### What is inferential stats ?
Inferential statistics is the application of mathematical methods to interpret the summarized and organized dataset. Usually, a sample is taken from the summarized data to infer and make predictions.

#### Why is inferential stats important ?
Applying inferential statistics to large datasets can be tremendously helpful in numerous areas of everyday life. It can help predict diseases, predict house prices, or predict which players in a basketball team has the highest percentage to score in a last minute shot of a game.

#### When to apply inferential stats ?
Inferential statistics is better to apply when a group or an individual wants to go beyond understanding a large dataset. Make a hypothesis and infer from the large dataset given.

#### Techniques used in inferential stats.
There are many techniques used in inferential stats to help make generalizations, predictions, and conclusions. The main two categories are estimations and hypothesis testing.
