### VARIABLES:

#### Random variables
Random variables are variables that have ranges of possible outcomes for a particular random process/phenomenon. In math notation it usually derives in a big `X`. An example would be a six sided die. `X = x` such that `x` may be between `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

In math, here‚Äôs how it reads. 
`ùëÉ(ùëã=ùë•)=1/6` for¬† `ùë•‚àà[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
This denotes that there are 6 possible equal outcomes. Between ranges `1` to `6`. 


#### Discrete variables

Discrete random variables are variables that can take a set of countable numbers. An example would be the 6 sided die that has 6 equal outcomes. A good rule of thumb is that a discrete random variable is that the sum of all the probabilities(across all discrete options) has to be exactly 1.

Here's an example of a discrete variables.
`[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]`


#### Discrete variables:

Continuous random variable are variables that can take a continues set of infinite number of values. For example a question maybe ask as to what is the exact winning time that winner of 2019 olympics won ? 

It could be `9.7123s` or `9.7122s` or `9.81s`. Unless the timing is rounded up or down. The variables are continuous.

### MATH INTERVALS:

#### Close interval = [] 
 Means the endpoints are closed
 For example, `[1, 5]`. The line starts with `1` and closes at `5`.

#### Open interval = ()
Means the endpoints are open 
 For example (1, 5). The line starts at `1.1~` to `4.9~`. `~` means that the number can be continuous. 

#### Close open interval
 Means the endpoints are open and close.
 For example `[1, 5)`. The line starts at `1` and ends to `4.9~`.

### DISTRIBUTION:

#### Normal distribution

This is called the a normal distribution or gaussian distribution. The formula for this is:

In this case, a formula will always be use in data science. There's no need to remember the formula. A few things are needed to understand the normal distribution. 

`Œº` or `mew` is the middle of the curve. In the above example, the `Œº` of the green line is 
-2.

`œÉ` or `sigma` is the standard deviation of the bell curve. It means, how far apart are the points are to each other. In the above example, the `œÉ` of the green line is 0.5.

Normal distribution is important to understand because it is used widely in inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, where the sample size is large (n>30).

#### Central Limit Theorem

Central limit theorem is given a dataset with unknown distribution(could be binomial, uniform, or random). The sample means will be close to the normal distribution.

To put it in simple words, when you add up and normalize independent random variables(like dice rolls), their sum tends to look like a normal distribution.


#### Sampling

Is when a subset of a particular dataset is taken to represent the whole dataset for hypotheses testing. The reason why this is done it's because it is practical and cost effective to collect a general and indpendent sample size to represent the whole population of a data.
