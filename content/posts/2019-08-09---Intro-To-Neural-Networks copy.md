#### What is deep learning ?
Deep learning refers to the training of neural networks. Neural networks, most of the time has large datasets involved.

#### What are neural networks ?
Neural networks are models that have multiple x inputs one y output. The model is fed with the x inputs inside a neuron which processes the inputs and somehow predicts the output.
